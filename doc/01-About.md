## History <a href="manubulon-snmp-plugins-about-history"></a>

These plugins have been written by Patrick Proy several years ago.

Many community members still use them, but development and patches
stopped.

I've used these plugins in my previous job, and decided to fork them
into this repository. Many patches have been applied, and put into
official releases for packagers.

This is reflected by moving each plugin into a v2.x version although
there are not so many changes.

I don't have a test system/hardware nor do much with these plugins these days.
Still this repository allows community members to send in their patches
and discuss bugs and feature requests.
